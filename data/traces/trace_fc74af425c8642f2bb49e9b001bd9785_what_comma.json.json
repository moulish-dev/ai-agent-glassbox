Depending on your Linux distribution, you can accomplish these operations in various ways.\n\nThe [Bash shell](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/bash-navigation) is usually the most efficient tool for file management. This article assumes you already have a basic understanding of how to open a Linux terminal and enter commands. (See [How to access the Linux terminal](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/access-linux-terminal) if you want a refresher.) Connect to your Linux terminal with your regular user account, and get ready to reorganize.\n\nChange to your home directory and [create a new directory](https://www.redhat.com/node/6007) named `mydir` for the exercises. The command to create a new directory is `mkdir`:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir mydir\n$ cd mydir/\n```\n\n## Move files and directories\n\nThe `mv` command moves both directories and files. Check its options and parameters from the `--help` results below:\n\n```bash\n$ mv --help\nUsage: mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST\n  or:  mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY\n  or:  mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...\nRename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.\n\nMandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.\n      --backup[=CONTROL]       make a backup of each existing destination file\n  -b                           like --backup but does not accept an argument\n  -f, --force                  do not prompt before overwriting\n  -i, --interactive            prompt before overwrite\n  -n, --no-clobber             do not overwrite an existing file\nIf you specify more than one of -i, -f, -n, only the final one takes effect.\n      --strip-trailing-slashes  remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE\n                                 argument\n  -S, --suffix=SUFFIX          override the usual backup suffix\n  -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY  move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY\n  -T, --no-target-directory    treat DEST as a normal file\n  -u, --update                 move only when the SOURCE file is newer\n                                 than the destination file or when the\n                                 destination file is missing\n  -v, --verbose                explain what is being done\n  -Z, --context                set SELinux security context of destination\n                                 file to default type\n      --help     display this help and exit\n      --version  output version information and exit\n\nThe backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.\nThe version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through\nthe VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:\n\n  none, off       never make backups (even if --backup is given)\n  numbered, t     make numbered backups\n  existing, nil   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise\n  simple, never   always make simple backups\n```\n\n## Rename files and directories\n\nYou also use the `mv` command to rename directories and files if the destination doesn't already exist. If the destination exists, then they're moved using the syntax `mv {source} {destination}`. Here is an example of moving existing files to existing directories:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 14:57 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 17:52 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 17:52 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:31 file1\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:33 file2\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:33 file3\n\n$ mv file1 dir1/\n\n$ mv file2 dir2/\n\n$ mv file3 dir3/\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n[mydir]$ ls -lR\n.:\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n\n./dir1:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:31 file1\n\n./dir2:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:33 file2\n\n./dir3:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:33 file3\n\n./dir4:\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:35 subdir1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:35 file4\n```\n\n**[ Boost your Bash skills. Download the Bash shell scripting cheat sheet. ]**\n\nAnd you can use the `mv` command to move directories into other directories:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -1\ndir1\ndir2\ndir3\ndir4\n\n$ mv dir1/ dir2/\n\n$ mv dir2/ dir3/\n\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\n```\n\nThe `dir1` and `dir2` directories still exist; you've just moved them. See what it looks like for yourself:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -R\ndir3\ndir4\n\n./dir3:\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir3/dir2:\ndir1\nfile2\n\n./dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4:\nsubdir1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\n## Copy files and directories\n\nThe `cp` command copies both files and directories. This command has many options, but the basic syntax is simple. Run `cp {source} {destination}` to copy from one place (source) to another (destination). Consider the following example:\n\n```\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\n\n$ cp dir4/subdir1/file4 .\n\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\nfile4\n\n$ ls -R dir4/\ndir4/:\nsubdir1\n\ndir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\n**[ Download the free Linux commands cheat sheet. ]**\n\nTo copy an entire directory with its contents, use the `-R` option, as seen below:\n\n```\n$ cp -R dir3/ dir4/\n\n$ ls -R\ndir3\ndir4\nfile4\n\n./dir3:\ntotal 0\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir3/dir2:\ndir1\nfile2\n\n./dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4:\ndir3\nsubdir1\n\n./dir4/dir3:\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir4/dir3/dir2:\nfile2\n\n./dir4/dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\nWhen you copy empty directories into other directories, there's no need for the `-R` parameter.\n\n## More to explore\n\nFor each command I've demonstrated, there are many more options I've left out for the sake of brevity.\n\nAs a sysadmin, you must know how to copy, move, and rename files and directories. These file-management commands are the basis of much of what you do on the system and are the building blocks for effective Linux administration. I hope this article aids you in understanding this topic, helps your Linux certification path, and adds to your general sysadmin knowledge.\n\nComponent | Card_header\n\n### About the author\n\nSubpattern | speaker\n\nCard layout\n\nGroup layout\n\nComponent | Image_embed\n\nGroup layout\n\nComponent | Person\n\n### Alexon Oliveira\n\nComponent | Person\n\nAlexon has been working as a Senior Technical Account Manager at Red Hat since 2018, working in the Customer Success organization focusing on Infrastructure and Management, Integration and Automation, Cloud Computing, and Storage Solutions.

Depending on your Linux distribution, you can accomplish these operations in various ways.\n\nThe [Bash shell](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/bash-navigation) is usually the most efficient tool for file management. This article assumes you already have a basic understanding of how to open a Linux terminal and enter commands. (See [How to access the Linux terminal](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/access-linux-terminal) if you want a refresher.) Connect to your Linux terminal with your regular user account, and get ready to reorganize.\n\nChange to your home directory and [create a new directory](https://www.redhat.com/node/6007) named `mydir` for the exercises. The command to create a new directory is `mkdir`:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir mydir\n$ cd mydir/\n```\n\n## Move files and directories\n\nThe `mv` command moves both directories and files. Check its options and parameters from the `--help` results below:\n\n```bash\n$ mv --help\nUsage: mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST\n  or:  mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY\n  or:  mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...\nRename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.\n\nMandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.\n      --backup[=CONTROL]       make a backup of each existing destination file\n  -b                           like --backup but does not accept an argument\n  -f, --force                  do not prompt before overwriting\n  -i, --interactive            prompt before overwrite\n  -n, --no-clobber             do not overwrite an existing file\nIf you specify more than one of -i, -f, -n, only the final one takes effect.\n      --strip-trailing-slashes  remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE\n                                 argument\n  -S, --suffix=SUFFIX          override the usual backup suffix\n  -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY  move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY\n  -T, --no-target-directory    treat DEST as a normal file\n  -u, --update                 move only when the SOURCE file is newer\n                                 than the destination file or when the\n                                 destination file is missing\n  -v, --verbose                explain what is being done\n  -Z, --context                set SELinux security context of destination\n                                 file to default type\n      --help     display this help and exit\n      --version  output version information and exit\n\nThe backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.\nThe version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through\nthe VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:\n\n  none, off       never make backups (even if --backup is given)\n  numbered, t     make numbered backups\n  existing, nil   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise\n  simple, never   always make simple backups\n```\n\n## Rename files and directories\n\nYou also use the `mv` command to rename directories and files if the destination doesn't already exist. If the destination exists, then they're moved using the syntax `mv {source} {destination}`. Here is an example of moving existing files to existing directories:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 14:57 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 17:52 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 17:52 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:31 file1\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:33 file2\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:33 file3\n\n$ mv file1 dir1/\n\n$ mv file2 dir2/\n\n$ mv file3 dir3/\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n[mydir]$ ls -lR\n.:\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n\n./dir1:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:31 file1\n\n./dir2:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:33 file2\n\n./dir3:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:33 file3\n\n./dir4:\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:35 subdir1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:35 file4\n```\n\n**[ Boost your Bash skills. Download the Bash shell scripting cheat sheet. ]**\n\nAnd you can use the `mv` command to move directories into other directories:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -1\ndir1\ndir2\ndir3\ndir4\n\n$ mv dir1/ dir2/\n\n$ mv dir2/ dir3/\n\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\n```\n\nThe `dir1` and `dir2` directories still exist; you've just moved them. See what it looks like for yourself:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -R\ndir3\ndir4\n\n./dir3:\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir3/dir2:\ndir1\nfile2\n\n./dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4:\nsubdir1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\n## Copy files and directories\n\nThe `cp` command copies both files and directories. This command has many options, but the basic syntax is simple. Run `cp {source} {destination}` to copy from one place (source) to another (destination). Consider the following example:\n\n```\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\n\n$ cp dir4/subdir1/file4 .\n\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\nfile4\n\n$ ls -R dir4/\ndir4/:\nsubdir1\n\ndir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\n**[ Download the free Linux commands cheat sheet. ]**\n\nTo copy an entire directory with its contents, use the `-R` option, as seen below:\n\n```\n$ cp -R dir3/ dir4/\n\n$ ls -R\ndir3\ndir4\nfile4\n\n./dir3:\ntotal 0\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir3/dir2:\ndir1\nfile2\n\n./dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4:\ndir3\nsubdir1\n\n./dir4/dir3:\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir4/dir3/dir2:\nfile2\n\n./dir4/dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\nWhen you copy empty directories into other directories, there's no need for the `-R` parameter.\n\n## More to explore\n\nFor each command I've demonstrated, there are many more options I've left out for the sake of brevity.\n\nAs a sysadmin, you must know how to copy, move, and rename files and directories. These file-management commands are the basis of much of what you do on the system and are the building blocks for effective Linux administration. I hope this article aids you in understanding this topic, helps your Linux certification path, and adds to your general sysadmin knowledge.\n\nComponent | Card_header\n\n### About the author\n\nSubpattern | speaker\n\nCard layout\n\nGroup layout\n\nComponent | Image_embed\n\nGroup layout\n\nComponent | Person\n\n### Alexon Oliveira\n\nComponent | Person\n\nAlexon has been working as a Senior Technical Account Manager at Red Hat since 2018, working in the Customer Success organization focusing on Infrastructure and Management, Integration and Automation, Cloud Computing, and Storage Solutions.

(See [How to access the Linux terminal](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/access-linux-terminal) if you want a refresher.) Connect to your Linux terminal with your regular user account, and get ready to reorganize.\n\nChange to your home directory and [create a new directory](https://www.redhat.com/node/6007) named `mydir` for the exercises. The command to create a new directory is `mkdir`:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir mydir\n$ cd mydir/\n```\n\n## Move files and directories\n\nThe `mv` command moves both directories and files. Check its options and parameters from the `--help` results below:\n\n```bash\n$ mv --help\nUsage: mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST\n  or:  mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY\n  or:  mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...\nRename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.\n\nMandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.\n      --backup[=CONTROL]       make a backup of each existing destination file\n  -b                           like --backup but does not accept an argument\n  -f, --force                  do not prompt before overwriting\n  -i, --interactive            prompt before overwrite\n  -n, --no-clobber             do not overwrite an existing file\nIf you specify more than one of -i, -f, -n, only the final one takes effect.\n      --strip-trailing-slashes  remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE\n                                 argument\n  -S, --suffix=SUFFIX          override the usual backup suffix\n  -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY  move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY\n  -T, --no-target-directory    treat DEST as a normal file\n  -u, --update                 move only when the SOURCE file is newer\n                                 than the destination file or when the\n                                 destination file is missing\n  -v, --verbose                explain what is being done\n  -Z, --context                set SELinux security context of destination\n                                 file to default type\n      --help     display this help and exit\n      --version  output version information and exit\n\nThe backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.\nThe version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through\nthe VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:\n\n  none, off       never make backups (even if --backup is given)\n  numbered, t     make numbered backups\n  existing, nil   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise\n  simple, never   always make simple backups\n```\n\n## Rename files and directories\n\nYou also use the `mv` command to rename directories and files if the destination doesn't already exist. If the destination exists, then they're moved using the syntax `mv {source} {destination}`. Here is an example of moving existing files to existing directories:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 14:57 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 17:52 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser  6 Jun  9 17:52 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:31 file1\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:33 file2\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser  0 Jun  9 17:33 file3\n\n$ mv file1 dir1/\n\n$ mv file2 dir2/\n\n$ mv file3 dir3/\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n[mydir]$ ls -lR\n.:\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir1\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir2\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:53 dir3\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 localuser localuser 21 Jun  9 16:57 dir4\n\n./dir1:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:31 file1\n\n./dir2:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:33 file2\n\n./dir3:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:33 file3\n\n./dir4:\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 localuser localuser 19 Jun  9 17:35 subdir1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 localuser localuser 0 Jun  9 17:35 file4\n```\n\n**[ Boost your Bash skills. Download the Bash shell scripting cheat sheet. ]**\n\nAnd you can use the `mv` command to move directories into other directories:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -1\ndir1\ndir2\ndir3\ndir4\n\n$ mv dir1/ dir2/\n\n$ mv dir2/ dir3/\n\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\n```\n\nThe `dir1` and `dir2` directories still exist; you've just moved them. See what it looks like for yourself:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -R\ndir3\ndir4\n\n./dir3:\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir3/dir2:\ndir1\nfile2\n\n./dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4:\nsubdir1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\n## Copy files and directories\n\nThe `cp` command copies both files and directories. This command has many options, but the basic syntax is simple. Run `cp {source} {destination}` to copy from one place (source) to another (destination). Consider the following example:\n\n```\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\n\n$ cp dir4/subdir1/file4 .\n\n$ ls -1\ndir3\ndir4\nfile4\n\n$ ls -R dir4/\ndir4/:\nsubdir1\n\ndir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\n**[ Download the free Linux commands cheat sheet. ]**\n\nTo copy an entire directory with its contents, use the `-R` option, as seen below:\n\n```\n$ cp -R dir3/ dir4/\n\n$ ls -R\ndir3\ndir4\nfile4\n\n./dir3:\ntotal 0\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir3/dir2:\ndir1\nfile2\n\n./dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4:\ndir3\nsubdir1\n\n./dir4/dir3:\ndir2\nfile3\n\n./dir4/dir3/dir2:\nfile2\n\n./dir4/dir3/dir2/dir1:\nfile1\n\n./dir4/subdir1:\nfile4\n```\n\nWhen you copy empty directories into other directories, there's no need for the `-R` parameter.\n\n## More to explore\n\nFor each command I've demonstrated, there are many more options I've left out for the sake of brevity.\n\nAs a sysadmin, you must know how to copy, move, and rename files and directories. These file-management commands are the basis of much of what you do on the system and are the building blocks for effective Linux administration. I hope this article aids you in understanding this topic, helps your Linux certification path, and adds to your general sysadmin knowledge.\n\nComponent | Card_header\n\n### About the author\n\nSubpattern | speaker\n\nCard layout\n\nGroup layout\n\nComponent | Image_embed\n\nGroup layout\n\nComponent | Person\n\n### Alexon Oliveira\n\nComponent | Person\n\nAlexon has been working as a Senior Technical Account Manager at Red Hat since 2018, working in the Customer Success organization focusing on Infrastructure and Management, Integration and Automation, Cloud Computing, and Storage Solutions.
