A process in Linux is nothing but a program in execution. It\u2019s a running instance of a program. Any command that you execute starts a process.\n\n## Types of Processes in Linux\n\nIn Linux processes can be of two types:\n\n- Foreground Processes depend on the user for input also referred to as interactive processes\n\nForeground Processes depend on the user for input also referred to as interactive processes\n\n- Background Processes run independently of the user referred to as non-interactive or automatic processes\n\nBackground Processes run independently of the user referred to as non-interactive or automatic processes\n\n### Process States in Linux\n\nA process in Linux can go through different states after it\u2019s created and before it\u2019s terminated. These states are:\n\n- Running\n\nRunning\n\n- Sleeping Interruptible sleep Uninterruptible sleep\n\nSleeping\n\n- Interruptible sleep\n\n- Uninterruptible sleep\n\n- Stopped\n\nStopped\n\n- Zombie\n\nZombie\n\n- A process in running state means that it is running or it\u2019s ready to run.\n\nA process in running state means that it is running or it\u2019s ready to run.\n\n- The process is in a sleeping state when it is waiting for a resource to be available.\n\nThe process is in a sleeping state when it is waiting for a resource to be available.\n\n- A process in Interruptible sleep will wakeup to handle signals, whereas a process in Uninterruptible sleep will not.\n\nA process in Interruptible sleep will wakeup to handle signals, whereas a process in Uninterruptible sleep will not.\n\n- A process enters a stopped state when it receives a stop signal.\n\nA process enters a stopped state when it receives a stop signal.\n\n- Zombie state is when a process is dead but the entry for the process is still present in the table.\n\nZombie state is when a process is dead but the entry for the process is still present in the table.\n\n## Different Commands for Process Management in Linux\n\nThere are two commands available in Linux to track running processes. These two commands are Top and Ps.\n\n### 1. The top Command for Mananging Linux Processes\n\nTo track the running processes on your machine you can use the top command.\n\n```bash\n$ top \n```\n\nTop command displays a list of processes that are running in real-time along with their memory and CPU usage. Let\u2019s understand the output a little better:\n\n- PID: Unique Process ID given to each process.\n\n- User: Username of the process owner.\n\n- PR: Priority given to a process while scheduling.\n\n- NI: \u2018nice\u2019 value of a process.\n\n- VIRT: Amount of virtual memory used by a process.\n\n- RES: Amount of physical memory used by a process.\n\n- SHR: Amount of memory shared with other processes.\n\n- S: state of the process \u2018D\u2019 = uninterruptible sleep \u2018R\u2019 = running \u2018S\u2019 = sleeping \u2018T\u2019 = traced or stopped \u2018Z\u2019 = zombie\n\n- \u2018D\u2019 = uninterruptible sleep\n\n- \u2018R\u2019 = running\n\n- \u2018S\u2019 = sleeping\n\n- \u2018T\u2019 = traced or stopped\n\n- \u2018Z\u2019 = zombie\n\n- %CPU: Percentage of CPU used by the process.\n\n- %MEM; Percentage of RAM used by the process.\n\n- TIME+: Total CPU time consumed by the process.\n\n- Command: Command used to activate the process.\n\nYou can use the up/down arrow keys to navigate up and down through the list. To quit press q. To kill a process, highlight the process with the up/down arrow keys and press \u2018k\u2019.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the kill command, which we will see later.\n\n### 2. ps command\n\nps command is short for \u2018Process Status\u2019. It displays the currently-running processes. However, unlike the top command, the output generated is not in realtime.\n\n```bash\n$ ps\n```\n\nThe terminology is as follows :\n\n|   |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| PID | process ID |\n| TTY | terminal type |\n| TIME | total time the process has been running |\n| CMD | name of the command that launches the process |\n\n```bash\n$ ps -u\n```\n\nHere:\n\n- %CPU represents the amount of computing power the process is taking.\n\n- %MEM represents the amount of memory the process is taking up.\n\n- STAT represents process state.\n\nWhile ps command only displays the processes that are currently running, you can also use it to list all the processes.\n\n```bash\n$ ps -A \n```\n\nThis command lists even those processes that are currently not running.\n\n### 3. Stop a process\n\nTo stop a process in Linux, use the 'kill\u2019 command. kill command sends a signal to the process.\n\nThere are different types of signals that you can send. However, the most common one is \u2018kill -9\u2019 which is \u2018SIGKILL\u2019.\n\nYou can list all the signals using:\n\n```bash\n$ kill -L\n```\n\nThe default signal is 15, which is SIGTERM. Which means if you just use the kill command without any number, it sends the SIGTERM signal.\n\nThe syntax for killing a process is:\n\n```bash\n$ kill [pid]\n```\n\nAlternatively you can also use :\n\n```bash\n$ kill -9 [pid]\n```\n\nThis command will send a \u2018SIGKILL\u2019 signal to the process. This should be used in case the process ignores a normal kill request.\n\n### 4. Change priority of a process\n\nIn Linux, you can prioritize between processes. The priority value for a process is called the \u2018Niceness\u2019 value. Niceness value can range from -20 to 19. 0 is the default value.\n\nThe fourth column in the output of top command is the column for niceness value.\n\nTo start a process and give it a nice value other than the default one, use:\n\n```bash\n$ nice -n [value] [process name]\n```\n\nTo change nice value of a process that is already running use:\n\n```bash\nrenice [value] -p 'PID'\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial covered process management in Linux. Mainly the practical aspects of process management were covered. In theory, process management is a vast topic and covering it in its entirety is out of scope for this tutorial.\n\nThanks for learning with the DigitalOcean Community.

Let\u2019s understand the output a little better:\n\n- PID: Unique Process ID given to each process.\n\n- User: Username of the process owner.\n\n- PR: Priority given to a process while scheduling.\n\n- NI: \u2018nice\u2019 value of a process.\n\n- VIRT: Amount of virtual memory used by a process.\n\n- RES: Amount of physical memory used by a process.\n\n- SHR: Amount of memory shared with other processes.\n\n- S: state of the process \u2018D\u2019 = uninterruptible sleep \u2018R\u2019 = running \u2018S\u2019 = sleeping \u2018T\u2019 = traced or stopped \u2018Z\u2019 = zombie\n\n- \u2018D\u2019 = uninterruptible sleep\n\n- \u2018R\u2019 = running\n\n- \u2018S\u2019 = sleeping\n\n- \u2018T\u2019 = traced or stopped\n\n- \u2018Z\u2019 = zombie\n\n- %CPU: Percentage of CPU used by the process.\n\n- %MEM; Percentage of RAM used by the process.\n\n- TIME+: Total CPU time consumed by the process.\n\n- Command: Command used to activate the process.\n\nYou can use the up/down arrow keys to navigate up and down through the list. To quit press q. To kill a process, highlight the process with the up/down arrow keys and press \u2018k\u2019.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the kill command, which we will see later.\n\n### 2. ps command\n\nps command is short for \u2018Process Status\u2019. It displays the currently-running processes. However, unlike the top command, the output generated is not in realtime.\n\n```bash\n$ ps\n```\n\nThe terminology is as follows :\n\n|   |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| PID | process ID |\n| TTY | terminal type |\n| TIME | total time the process has been running |\n| CMD | name of the command that launches the process |\n\n```bash\n$ ps -u\n```\n\nHere:\n\n- %CPU represents the amount of computing power the process is taking.\n\n- %MEM represents the amount of memory the process is taking up.\n\n- STAT represents process state.\n\nWhile ps command only displays the processes that are currently running, you can also use it to list all the processes.\n\n```bash\n$ ps -A \n```\n\nThis command lists even those processes that are currently not running.\n\n### 3. Stop a process\n\nTo stop a process in Linux, use the 'kill\u2019 command. kill command sends a signal to the process.\n\nThere are different types of signals that you can send. However, the most common one is \u2018kill -9\u2019 which is \u2018SIGKILL\u2019.\n\nYou can list all the signals using:\n\n```bash\n$ kill -L\n```\n\nThe default signal is 15, which is SIGTERM. Which means if you just use the kill command without any number, it sends the SIGTERM signal.\n\nThe syntax for killing a process is:\n\n```bash\n$ kill [pid]\n```\n\nAlternatively you can also use :\n\n```bash\n$ kill -9 [pid]\n```\n\nThis command will send a \u2018SIGKILL\u2019 signal to the process. This should be used in case the process ignores a normal kill request.\n\n### 4. Change priority of a process\n\nIn Linux, you can prioritize between processes. The priority value for a process is called the \u2018Niceness\u2019 value. Niceness value can range from -20 to 19. 0 is the default value.\n\nThe fourth column in the output of top command is the column for niceness value.\n\nTo start a process and give it a nice value other than the default one, use:\n\n```bash\n$ nice -n [value] [process name]\n```\n\nTo change nice value of a process that is already running use:\n\n```bash\nrenice [value] -p 'PID'\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial covered process management in Linux. Mainly the practical aspects of process management were covered. In theory, process management is a vast topic and covering it in its entirety is out of scope for this tutorial.\n\nThanks for learning with the DigitalOcean Community.

A process in Linux is nothing but a program in execution. It\u2019s a running instance of a program. Any command that you execute starts a process.\n\n## Types of Processes in Linux\n\nIn Linux processes can be of two types:\n\n- Foreground Processes depend on the user for input also referred to as interactive processes\n\nForeground Processes depend on the user for input also referred to as interactive processes\n\n- Background Processes run independently of the user referred to as non-interactive or automatic processes\n\nBackground Processes run independently of the user referred to as non-interactive or automatic processes\n\n### Process States in Linux\n\nA process in Linux can go through different states after it\u2019s created and before it\u2019s terminated. These states are:\n\n- Running\n\nRunning\n\n- Sleeping Interruptible sleep Uninterruptible sleep\n\nSleeping\n\n- Interruptible sleep\n\n- Uninterruptible sleep\n\n- Stopped\n\nStopped\n\n- Zombie\n\nZombie\n\n- A process in running state means that it is running or it\u2019s ready to run.\n\nA process in running state means that it is running or it\u2019s ready to run.\n\n- The process is in a sleeping state when it is waiting for a resource to be available.\n\nThe process is in a sleeping state when it is waiting for a resource to be available.\n\n- A process in Interruptible sleep will wakeup to handle signals, whereas a process in Uninterruptible sleep will not.\n\nA process in Interruptible sleep will wakeup to handle signals, whereas a process in Uninterruptible sleep will not.\n\n- A process enters a stopped state when it receives a stop signal.\n\nA process enters a stopped state when it receives a stop signal.\n\n- Zombie state is when a process is dead but the entry for the process is still present in the table.\n\nZombie state is when a process is dead but the entry for the process is still present in the table.\n\n## Different Commands for Process Management in Linux\n\nThere are two commands available in Linux to track running processes.
